Sure, here's an example README file for the data tables you provided:

# README

This dataset contains information about genomic data files related to the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) project. The data tables provided in this dataset include information about file paths, filenames, file types, file sizes, and other details for various genomic data files.

The data tables are provided in a comma-separated value (CSV) format, with one row per file. The following fields are included in each row:

- md5key: a unique identifier for each file based on its MD5 checksum
- filepath: the path to the directory where the file is located
- filename: the name of the file
- filetype: the type of file (e.g. BAM, VCF)
- indexfile: the name of the index file for the primary file
- filesize: the size of the file in gigabytes (GB)
- readme: the path to the readme file associated with the data file
- giab_id: the GIAB identifier for the sample used to generate the data file
- biosample: the biosample ID for the sample used to generate the data file
- trio: the trio ID for the sample used to generate the data file
- dna_id: the DNA ID for the sample used to generate the data file
- notes: any additional notes or comments about the file
- year: the year in which the file was generated
- month: the month in which the file was generated

The data tables are intended to be used for research purposes related to genomic analysis and quality control. Users of the data should consult the readme files associated with each data file for more information about the data and any caveats or limitations associated with its use.

If you have any questions or concerns about the data tables, please contact the Genome in a Bottle project team.
