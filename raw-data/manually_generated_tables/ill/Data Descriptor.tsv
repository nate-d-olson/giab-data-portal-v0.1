Notes (cell highlight)	#purple	No MD5 files
NA	#tan	The HG002 2x250 fastqs had 2 MD5 files but none of the other folders did
NA	#cyan	Any idea who did the 10X sequencing?
NA	#yellow	Readme says 13-17x across all sequenced genomic positions but 400x in physical coverage. Which do you want to use?
NA	#light red	Readme does not discuss analysis, no coverage listed
NA	#green	Readme does not specify coverage for these bams
