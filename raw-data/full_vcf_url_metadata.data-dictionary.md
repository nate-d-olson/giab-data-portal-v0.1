1. **sequencing_technology**: The technology used to sequence the DNA sample. This could be IonTorrent, PACBIO, Roche, Bionano, 10XGenomics, etc. These are names of companies that produce different DNA sequencing technologies.

2. **center**: The center or institute where the sequencing was performed. This can be universities (like OsloUniversityHospital), companies (like PacBio or Bionano), or research groups (like Broad).

3. **trio**: The group of individuals sequenced. This can be a trio of individuals from a specific population or family, such as the AshkenazimTrio or ChineseTrio. In this case, a trio often represents a mother, a father, and a child.

4. **sample_id**: The specific ID of the individual sample that was sequenced. This can refer to individual members within a trio (like HG002, HG003, HG004) or to a whole trio.

5. **variant_caller**: The software tool used to identify variants in the sequenced sample. This can include tools like TVC, deepvariant, GATK, MetaSV, lumpy, svaba, LongRanger, etc.

6. **date**: The date when the analysis was performed. It is formatted as MMDDYYYY.

7. **url**: The URL where the data or result of the analysis is hosted. This often points to a specific file such as a .vcf (Variant Call Format) file which contains the identified genetic variants from the sequencing.

8. **ref_genome**: The reference genome used for aligning the sequenced data and variant calling. This can be versions of the human reference genome such as GRCh37 or GRCh38.
